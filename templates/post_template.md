Youâ€™ll find all blog posts in your `_posts` directory. Copy this template and edit it to add your own post. Make sure to add all required header information at the top of the page. 

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Some common markdown is listed below for your convince.
