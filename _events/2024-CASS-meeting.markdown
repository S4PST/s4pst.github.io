The newly formed Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS) has its first in person meeting at Argonne National Laboratory on July 24. The event was collocated as the 3rd day of the Partnering for Scientific Software Ecosystem Stewardship, [PESO](https://pesoproject.org/) project meeting, July 22-24. The event website can be found [here](https://web.cvent.com/event/2fc77a4d-5b8a-4198-9edf-cf83034d516d/summary).

S4PST members, and those also members of PESO, participated in both meetings fostering collaboration across CASS and PESO organizations.
