The first S4PST Phase-I Workshop was held for two days in May 11-12, 2023 at the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://icl.utk.edu/) at the University of Tenneessee, Knoxville.

The event gather 30 participants from various institutions and organizations. The workshop was centered around future models for sustaining the investment in software and tools for the HPC community. In particular, the legacy of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), 2016-2023. Participants included active members of ECP projects, as well as representatives from the broader HPC community (e.g. vendors, academia) as well two seeds projects funded by the software sustainability initiative: [STEP]() and [SWAS](). People had the chance to exchange ideas, experiences, and lessons learned from ECP and other software projects to set a vision for the near-future. The full report became available in August 2023 as we prepared for phase-II of the project, and is available [here](https://ornl.github.io/events/2023-06-20-S4PST-files/S4PST-May-Workshop-Report.pdf).
