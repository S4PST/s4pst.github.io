We summarize the latest news and updates from the S4PST community from this past summer. Highlights include new publications, major software improvements, and awards.

### Publications

1. Christian Munley, Aaron Jarmusch, and Sunita Chandrasekaran. *"LLM4VV: Developing LLM-driven testsuite for compiler validation."* Future Generation Computer Systems (2024) [doi:10.1016/j.future.2024.05.034](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2024.05.034).

2. William Godoy, Pedro Valero-Lara, Keita Teranishi, Prasana Balaprakash, Jeffrey S Vetter. *"Large Language Model evaluation for High-Performance
Computing Software Development"* Concurrency and Computations: Practice and Experience (2024) [doi:10.1002/cpe.7000](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.7000).

### Major Software Improvements

1. Topology-aware MPI Shared Memory Communication for Aurora: The MPICH team has developed a new topology-aware MPI shared memory communication for Aurora, which is a key component for the upcoming exascale system.
   
2. Improvements to LLVM offloading: the LLVM team has made significant improvements to the offloading capabilities of the C++ and Fortran (Flang) compilers.
   
3. Improvements to Flang testing: the Fortran team is investigating whether agile techniques, including test-driven development (TDD), accelerate Flangâ€™s progress toward compliance with the Fortran 2023 standard. Tests have identified bugs that led to 41 patches to the LLVM Project main branch.

4. Improvements in GASNet-EX HPC communication. The GASNet-EX team has made significant improvements to the GASNet-EX library.

### Awards

1. Yuguo Kelly Tang received the best poster award (2 out of 29) for "Comparing JACC in modern CPU/GPU for Performance Portability in Julia" at ORNL's summer intern poster session.
