S4PST is proud to co-sponsor members to participate in activities at the premier [IEEE/ACM SC25 Conference](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/) in November 16-21 in St Louis, MO. The work and activities reported are partially funded by S4PST and in collaboration with other stakeholders to showcase the impact of the activities around the software portfolio.

As members of the Consortium of the Advacement of Scientific Software (CASS) we contributed to the curated list of 24 events including papers, posters, BoFs and tutorial participation co-sponsored by S4PST. The full list can be found in the CASS website [here]](https://cass.community/news/2025-11-16-sc25.html).
