S4PST is proud to co-sponsor members to participate in activities at the premier [IEEE/ACM SC24 Conference](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/) in November 17-22 in Atlanta, GA. The work and activities reported are partially funded by S4PST and in collaboration with other stakeholders to showcase the impact of the activities around the software portfolio.
We are excited to share our work and engage with the broader community. Please join us at the following SC24 events:
